## Getting Started with Web3.js

Web3.js is a set of modules created for connecting to an Ethereum node. In this tutorial we will be focusing on the Ethereum's JavaScript API.

To better understand the web3.js modules and how to use them, we'll create an auction dApp (decentralized application), and utilize some prominently used libraries. 

### How web3.js works

The Ethereum node only understands JSON RPC, so what web3.js does is translates the JSON RPC code, so that you can send a JSON object into something that you can easily use in JavaScript. 

The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) executes based on the generated bytecode from the Ethereum Smart Contract. Web3.js helps translate these functions into ABI (Application Binary Interface) encoding, so that the EVM can understand it, and store the resulting state on the blockchain.

We will take a closer look at how individual web3.js modules work as we go along with the tutorial.

### Requirements

1. Basic understanding of how Ethereum works.
2. Familiarity with JavaScript (promises, events)
3. Familiarity with writing smart contracts using Solidity.
